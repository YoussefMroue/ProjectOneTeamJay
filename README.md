## Project Description/Outline
Understanding gun violence in the U.S. between 2013 and 2018.

## Research Questions to Answer
Which states have the top percentage of incidents per capita?

How does the average number of people injured per incident vary per state?

What was the most frequent incident type per state? by year?
  
## Data Sets to be Used
* [Gun Violence Data] (https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data)
* [GMaps API's](developers.google.com/apis-explorer)
* [Government](census.gov/data.html)
* [Wrapper for the United States Census Bureau's API] (https://github.com/datamade/census)

## Parameters and Limitations of our Data Sets
* Gun Violence Data:
  * Includes data for gun violence incidents in the United States that occurred between 2013 and 2018.
  * Includes data for all 50 states and includes District of Columbia as its own state
  * What qualifies as a gun violence incidet? A gun violence incidents includes, but is not limited to, armed robberies, pistol whipping, suicide...
* Census Data:
  * Includes the 5 year average population per state (2011 - 2016)
  
 ## Important to Note
 * Per capita calculations are based on per 10,000
 * In regards to incident type, one gun violence incident can be counted as multiple incident types. For example, a single incident involving drug use and suicide would be counted twice as two different incident types.
